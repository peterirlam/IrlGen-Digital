## üé± &nbsp; Why I Chose This Project

I wanted to showcase my ability in SASS

## üèóÔ∏è &nbsp; How I Worked on This Project (This might be a bit overkill at this stage except last point - Julia and Sean do not include this)

- I built this app using the branding colors of Siteground as inspiration: [Siteground](https://www.siteground.co.uk/)
- I worked with tasks using Trello as a project management tool 
- I created feature branches using git

## Why I Built the Project using SASS

Back in 2021 I had no knowledge of SASS. I realised that this was a weakness that I needed to address as many companies
use SASS to help dry up their code for large applications as well as taking advantage of the built-in features which
CSS cannot offer.

## ‚è≤Ô∏è &nbsp; If I Had More Time I Would Change

The time zone displays for the 3 offices. I originally thought this would be a cool feature but I don't like the overall 
design - it looks rather basic and a little amateurish. 

Practical applications: In a real world scenario it could potentially confuse a user, especially
one who's not very IT literate - "Do I use the contact form, or email an office? If I do fill out the contact form, which office will receive it?". 

I may replace this section with some more 'social proof'. The testimonial section on the work page is clean and functional 
but nothing amazing. I may add a more advanced testimonial on the contacts page to encourage a user to get in touch, one that
has some nice hover animation features perhaps. 

Or simply 'Kill my darlings' as they say in the writing business. 

I also intend to add a sticky and mobile navigation.
